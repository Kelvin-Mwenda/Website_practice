       <b> Hello there! I'm Eliud Marierie, a passionate tech Boy based in Juja JKUAT. I have always been captivated by tech and NATURE, which has fueled my journey into the world of Computer Science.
        
        My professional background spans 2 years, during which I've honed my skills. I thrive on problem-solving, creative challenges and innovation.

        When I'm not immersed in computing, you can find me in Music, art and sports too . Whether it's art or art I'm in, I find these pursuits complement my professional life, keeping me energized and creative.
        
        I'm incredibly excited about what the future of computing holds. I'm dedicated to be part of what the future antails.
